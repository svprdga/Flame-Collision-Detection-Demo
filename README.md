# Flame Collision Detection

This is a sample project showing how to handle collisions in [Flame Engine](https://flame-engine.org/).

I am not an expert in collisions in a 2D environment, so I guess that there are better solutions. If you think that you can enhance the detection algorithm please contribute a PR!
